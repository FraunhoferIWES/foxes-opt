Welcome to *foxes-opt*
======================

.. versionadded:: 0.3
    Running wind farm optimizations through :ref:`Input parameter files <Input parameter files>` in *yaml* format,
    simply by `foxes_opt_yaml imputs.yaml` - no Python script needed.

The package *foxes-opt* provides optimization functionality for the
*Farm Optimization and eXtended yield Evaluation Software* `foxes <https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/foxes>`_
and is based on the optimization interface `iwopy <https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/iwopy>`_.

All three open-source Python packages *foxes*, *foxes-opt* and *iwopy* are provided and maintained by Fraunhofer IWES.

The calculation is fully vectorized and its fast performance is owed to `dask <https://www.dask.org/>`_.
Also the parallelization on local or remote clusters is enabled via `dask`. The wind farm
optimization capabilities invoke the `iwopy <https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/iwopy>`_
package which as well supports vectorization.
